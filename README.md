# Discord-Bot-NLP
this is a discord chatbot start your message with * to talk to the bot and itll reply!
set-up
edit: you should use a virtuale env some pre installed libraries caused me some trouble when trying to run this code...
this bot runs on your local machine, i couldnt get it to work on other free servers because it was too memory intensive. anyway download this repo and install the libraries in the requirements.txt file
edit basic_discord.py and on the last line change the token parameter to your token. to get a token you can follow the steps outlined in every tutorial about how to create a discord bot
just follow any video and get the token and replacd it with mine on the last line of code, then copy the bots link and add it to your server (you must be the servers admin to add it! i recomend crearing a test server)
then just run basic_discord.py aaand youre done. start your message with *
